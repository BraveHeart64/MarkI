          Sole is a software License agreement between the Developer and users. Under Sol, all the right of the software belong to developers that created it. 
          The main goal of Sol is to find a healthy medium between the developers and users. 
          Sol was designed to fix the flaws in the Open Source license agreements such as the GNU GPL2, GPL3 and MITS Licenses. 
          It has  come to the author of Sol attention that its is hard to make a living off Software Development if you give away your code for free; 
          however, the users should have the ability to gain access to the source code under the right conditions a compromise can be found. 
          Think of Sol as a Capitalist friendly Open Source License that encourages innovation. 

Terms and Conditions
          1. Programs released under Sol are initially Closed Source Software. The Author of the Software has the right to the code. 
          The user upon either buying the software or if the software was given to them for free, has the right to use the software as 
          long as they do not attempt to reverse engineer the software 
          or give it away for free. If the user desires to access the source code, he or she must ask the developer if 
          they can buy rights to access or own the source code. 
          
        1.A upon request, the developer can either sell the Software out right or sell access to the Source Code. 
          If the user buys access to source code, then the user has the right to make a derivative work for commercial, private or educational use 
          as long as the user states any changes to the new work and gives credit to the original developer. 
          The new project must also be released under the Sole License. 
          All new code belongs to the users but the original code belongs to the original author of the software.
          Buying the Source code allows you to create a new work and sell the binary/executable file only.
          The user does not have the right to sell the source code or give it away for others to use it unless they transfer their rights to use the 
          software. Alternatively, the user can buy as many access rights for others to use.


          1.B If the user decides to buy the Software, then the developer must also sell the documentation, such as UML Diagrams, State Diagrams ect.
          The user has all rights stated in section 1.A but now has a few additional freedoms. T
          he user now has the right to sell access to their modified source code. 
          A new notice must be included at the top of this license stating that this work is a derivative work.
          The document must state the name of the original work. The user now has the right to sell their modified software. 
          The User agreement in this case will make the formal user a developer with those privileges being applied for the Derivative work that was created.

          2. Any person is free to use the source code for educational and non-commercial use as long as
          You state where you got it from and include the Sole License, you are free to download an educational version of the software or study 
          if the software is made available for non-commercial and private use. Under this section, you are not permitted to sell the software's 
          binary or source code unless you have purchased access to the source code or you paid for the software.


         3. If a corporation, LLC or individual creates a service using the software, then
            20% of all profits made must be paid to the developer of the software. 
            3.A The Sol License does not override other licenses. If a developer uses, for example, a GNU library to make a program, 
            then the GNU License applies to the GNU Program and the Sole only applies to the newly written software that may rely on
            the GNU Frame Work. It is advisable for developers to include all licenses from software they use to create a work under this clause.

          4. If you violate the rules of this license, you will be given a warning with reasonable time to correct the error
             if the offending party fails to comply, then the offender will lose the rights associated with the license 
             and possible legal action could ensue. The Sol License was created in hopes to give developers and users equal rights under a hybrid open-source and business-friendly license.
